# Intro

I am a second-year master's student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, where my research centers on reinforcement learning (RL) as the foundation of Physical AI. I use RL to study how agents explore, adapt, and continuously improve their actions in the real world. My goal is to move beyond reward maximization and benchmarks, and build agents that learn and explore efficiently in the wild, generalize across tasks, and act in ways people can understand and trust.
<br>
<br>
At Penn, I work on several directions that reflect this vision:

- Under the guidance of Professors [Eric Eaton](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/), [Jorge Méndez Méndez](https://jorge-a-mendez.github.io/), and [Dani S. Bassett](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/personal), I study compositional zero-shot data generation, where agents can tackle new tasks by recombining prior knowledge.

- Supervised by Professors [Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/) and [Osbert Bastani](https://obastani.github.io/), I develop LLM-guided reward design, conduct large-scale RL training for dexterous tool use with the Franka arm, and work on articulated simulation alignment with real-world physics.

- I also learn a lot from the mentorship of [Marcel Hussing](https://marcelhussing.github.io/), who focuses on stable and reliable RL, and [Junyao Shi](https://junyaoshi.github.io/), who brings internet-scale data and foundation models into robotics. Their guidance reflects my vision of reliable and scalable Reinforcement Learning as the driver of continuous improvement and sim-to-real transfer, supported by developments in foundation models to leverage internet data for high-level world understanding.

Before Penn, I studied interpretable reinforcement learning at A*STAR Singapore under [Dr. Senthilnath Jayavelu](https://sites.google.com/site/jsenthilnath/), focusing on symbolic policies and latent representations to improve transparency in decision-making. As an undergraduate at [VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/) with Professor [Van-Dinh Nguyen](https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/nguyen-van-dinh-phd/), I applied RL to next-generation telecommunication networks, exploring resource allocation and network slicing, and completed my thesis on adaptive robotic parameter optimization using RL. As an engineering lead intern at Huawei Vietnam, I applied machine learning to IoT systems, leading a project on sleep-stage classification and representing Vietnam at the Asia-Pacific Seeds for the Future Summit.

# Off the field
I rarely have free time, but when I do, I enjoy reading about tech entrepreneurship 
and analyzing football (soccer) tactics. I also love playing football and making music. 
In college, I formed a band with my dorm mates, playing Pop, Rock, and Ballads. 
I primarily play the drums, but I also occasionally pick up the guitar and sing as well. 
[HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=373mu6j9DU0) was our debut performance back in summer 2023.

In Vietnam, people typically refer to each other by their middle and first names, 
so I prefer to be called "Quan" (first name) or "Anh Quan". 
You can also call me "Bill", a nickname my family has used for me since I was born.
<br>
<br>
In university (back when I was younger), I was quite an energetic kid. I founded the VinUni Football Community in Hanoi, which was the first and only intramural sports community at the school. I also served as the Vice President of Professional for VinUni Harmony, where I advised and managed numerous musical products, shows, and performances. Similarly, in high school, I established the Football Club at Ly Tu Trong High School for the Gifted (LTT FC), which is still active in Ho Chi Minh City and Can Tho. So, if you ever find yourself in Vietnam and want to experience some local soccer, just let me know. I'm part of active teams across the country!
