# Intro

I am currently a first-year master's student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, 
with a keen interest in Physical AI, where machine learning intersects with robotics. 
My goal is to develop intelligent and resilient robotic systems that 
possess enhanced capabilities and performance to assist humans in safety-critical environments. 
I am particularly focused on creating efficient methods that enable robots to learn from 
privileged multimodal data, thereby improving their generalization abilities to execute complex tasks effectively, 
from simulations to real-world applications. 
I believe that advancing generalized robotic modules will simplify the creation of intelligent 
physical agents, making it increasingly accessible for individuals to build their own robots—whether 
they are versatile general-purpose models or specialized DIY robots designed for specific tasks.

# Off the field
I rarely have free time, but when I do, I enjoy reading about tech entrepreneurship 
and analyzing football (soccer) tactics. I also love playing football and making music. 
In college, I formed a band with my dorm mates, playing Pop, Rock, and Ballads. 
I primarily play the drums, but I also occasionally pick up the guitar and sing as well. 
[HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=373mu6j9DU0) was our debut performance back in summer 2023.

In Vietnam, people typically refer to each other by their middle and first names, 
so I prefer to be called "Quan" (first name) or "Anh Quan". 
You can also call me "Bill", a nickname my family has used for me since I was born.

<br>
In university (back when I was younger), I was quite an energetic kid. I founded the VinUni Football Community in Hanoi, which was the first and only intramural sports community at the school. I also served as the Vice President of Professional for VinUni Harmony, where I advised and managed numerous musical products, shows, and performances. Similarly, in high school, I established the Football Club at Ly Tu Trong High School for the Gifted (LTT FC), which is still active in Ho Chi Minh City and Can Tho. So, if you ever find yourself in Vietnam and want to experience some local soccer, just let me know. I'm part of active teams across the country!
